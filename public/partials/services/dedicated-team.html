                <a href="/#home">Centaure–∞</a> is ready to offer you a team of <a href="/#about">highly qualified professionals</a>
                possessing necessary <a href="/#technologies">skills</a> and deep <a href="/#technologies">knowledge</a> needed to achieve the client`s
                goals while spending reasonable amount of resources.

                Dedicated team model allows companies to hire their own software development
                staff and manage them directly. It is ideal for any company who needs more
                developers and IT professionals, but is unable to hire them because of different reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we do not have the required staff at the moment, <a href="/#contact">we are ready</a> to build personally
                the team you need (this option is available in case of a <strong>long-term relationship only</strong>).
