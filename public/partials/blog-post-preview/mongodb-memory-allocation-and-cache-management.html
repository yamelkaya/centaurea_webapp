    MongoDB uses memory mapped files for file management, so in this component it relies a
    lot on OS side. But letâ€™s look at it based on linux OS. MongoDB maps files into memory
    using standard <i>mmap</i> call from <i>glibc</i>.</p>
<p>How it works</p>

<p>
    On start, MongoDB maps all its data storage files into memory. RAM is not used at all,
    this process only reserves the address space. This is reflected as virtual memory usage
    by mongod process. They can be found either in <i>top (VIRT)</i> or in MongoDB monitor
    (Memory Virt). Basically they reflect the data + indexes size. Res/RSS memory usage
    doesn't reflect anything relevant at all.
