                            <p>In this article described some details of memory allocation by MongoDB.</p>
                            <p>
                                MongoDB uses memory mapped files for file management, so in this component it relies a
                                lot on OS side. But letâ€™s look at it based on linux OS. MongoDB maps files into memory
                                using standard <i>mmap</i> call from <i>glibc</i>.</p>
                            <h3>How it works</h3>
                            <p>
                                On start, MongoDB maps all its data storage files into memory. RAM is not used at all,
                                this process only reserves the address space. This is reflected as virtual memory usage
                                by mongod process. They can be found either in <i>top (VIRT)</i> or in MongoDB monitor
                                (Memory Virt). Basically they reflect the data + indexes size. Res/RSS memory usage
                                doesn't reflect anything relevant at all.</p>
                            <p>
                                So in a sense all data and indexes are in memory, split by small memory pages. MongoDB
                                has pointers to each page. But they are not in RAM yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now when an actual query is made, MongoDB finds the page that contains the required data
                                and reads that data. It reads it from memory in general, and it doesn't care if the data
                                is in RAM or not. It can't know that, it just sends the request to the address in memory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rest is up to OS. It initializes those pages in RAM on their first usage. Such
                                initialized pages are known as cache pages, their total size can be seen with the
                                command <i>'free'</i> (column 'cached'). The problem is that OS expires them after
                                some time. This expiration is inevitable no matter how much RAM is available. It is an
                                OS-wide process based on recency of usage. There is a <i>kswapd</i> process that runs periodically
                                and checks whether the page has been accessed since the previous run. If it has, it does
                                nothing. If it hasn't, it divides the age by two. When the age reaches zero, this page
                                becomes a candidate for eviction. (Well, it never becomes zero, probably just close to it
                                enough, I don't know exact math behind it).
                            </p>
                            <p>This mechanism, file mmap'ing, is used for every file in the system. Log files are mmap'ed
                                as well, so the more logs, the more RAM used by cache pages.</p>
                            <p>
                                There is some dependency on RAM usage: the higher is the 'active' RAM usage (see <i>vmstat -s</i>),
                                the more frequently <i>kswapd</i> runs and the faster is the aging process.
                                MongoDB reports the actual size of data in RAM and the maximal age of that data. So we
                                could see that in case of memory management mongodb are pretty much rely on the OS side
                                and this could caused some downside effects like cache expiration and purging of data from
                                RAM just because OS think that data should be expired already.
                            </p>

                            <p>Cassandra uses the same mmap thing BTW.</p>
